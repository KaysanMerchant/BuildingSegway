# Concepts

To begin the process of designing a segway for the TER3 course, we must first get a list of items that we would like to include in it.

## List of Items

- 2 wheels
- A handlebar
    - Has a throttle on the handle for speed control
- Platform to stand on
- Hidden battery
- Charging port
- 2 motors for individual wheel control
- Gyroscope
    - Control balance of the segway
    - Allow for turning by leaning
        - Gyroscope will detect leaning and give more power to the opposite wheel to turn
